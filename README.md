# KBDInds (Keyboard Indicators)

Displays an icon in the system tray which indicates (!) whether the keyboard's Numlock, Capslock or ScrollLock are on.

Useful for keyboards that don't have LEDs for some or all of those keys.

Shamelessly pinched from an AutoHotKey script of the same name.

No licence restrictions. It's yours. Take it.

If you need a build of this application, let me know in Discussions (https://github.com/BazzaCuda/KBDInds/discussions) and I'll happily provide one for you, Windows 32-bit or 64-bit.
