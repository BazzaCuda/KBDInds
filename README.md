# KBDInds (Keyboard Indicators)

Displays an icon in the system tray which indicates (!) whether the keyboard's Numlock, Capslock or ScrollLock are on.

Useful for keyboards that don't have LEDs for any or all of those keys.

Shamelessly pinched from an AutoHotKey script of the same name.

No licence restrictions. It's yours. Take it.
